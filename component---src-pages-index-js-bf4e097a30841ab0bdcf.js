I've always wanted to explore not just the world around me, but the universe as well. Maintaining this website allows me to record my journey, as I explore the universe. Another purpose of the site is to offer insights as I navigate through my professional journey. I am a software engineer at Microsoft, working on the Edge browser. As a developer on the web platform team, I've been able to learn quite a bit about how browsers (especially chromium based ones) operate. Therefore, I will use this space to also share ideas and tools that I have found interesting and useful as a developer of the browser and developer for the browser.")),o.createElement("footer",{style:{background:"rgb(248,248,248)",marginTop:"20px"}},o.createElement("div",{class:"footericon"},o.createElement("a",{href:"http://github.com/sahirv"},"Github")),o.createElement("div",{class:"footericon"},o.createElement("a",{href:"http://linkedin.com/in/sahirvellani"},"LinkedIn")),o.createElement("div",{class:"footericon"},o.createElement("a",{href:"http://instagram.com/sahirv.photos"},"Instagram")),o.createElement("div",{class:"footericon"},o.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQbjLiDQUu-gUJ-drcX-8MQ"},"YouTube"))))}}}]);
