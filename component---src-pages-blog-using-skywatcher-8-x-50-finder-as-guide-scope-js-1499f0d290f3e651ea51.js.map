Since this is roughly the size of the average guidescope,\n        I thought I could convert this to one. There are many people who have done this and there are plenty of posts about it in forums like CloudyNights.\n        However, most people use <a href=\"https://www.firstlightoptics.com/adapters/astro-essentials-sky-watcher-9x50-finder-to-c-adapter.html\">this</a> adapter to connect their camera to the scope. I thought I could save this money and have it 3D printed \n        instead - thus saving on shipping costs.\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>I'm not much of an expert in CAD so I looked on thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file of the adapter.\n        I found <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3483611/files\">this part</a> and thought it looked promising. Some quick searches revealed that the Datyson\n        was similar to the ZWO 120mm Mini camera I owned, so I had it printed from a local 3D printing shop for $5. Below left is the 3D printed part.\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\n          <Img fluid={{...data.adapters.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>The part threaded well into the Sky-Watcher finder, but didn't fit properly into the 1.25\" thread on the camera.\n        So I had to improvise. The 120mm mini came with a 1.25\" to C thread adapter. I simply took this adapter and super glued the female C thread side to the \n        1.25\" side on the 3D printed adapter.</div>\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>Unfortunately I hit one more snag. As I tested the camera and new guide scope on random objects in my room, I was unable\n        to achieve focus. Turns out the camera was too close to the objective lens of the finder scope. In order to solve this issue, I used a junk \n        Celestron 1.25\" T adapter lying around. I unscrewed the silver extension bit and T adapter, and was able to thread in the camera from one end and\n        in the other end slide in the guide scope with 3D printed adapter + superglued C adapted + 1.25\" extension tube that came with the 120mm mini in the \n        box. See the full assembly below.</div>\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\n          <Img fluid={{...data.assembly.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>This solution was fairly hacked together with things lying around in my house, but overall the connection\n        from the guide scope to the camera is very sturdy. I plugged my new guide scope in to my computer, switched on Sharpcap, and the whole\n        thing worked well. Here's a screenshot of sharpcap as I point the scope to a trophy in my room.</div>\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\n          <Img fluid={{...data.sharpcap.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\n        </div>\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>I had to do a lot of googling to find the right 3D printable adapter, as well as whether the 8x50 finder\n        would even work at all as a guide scope. I hope this post has helped in informing you that it is possible and that it works well. Some improvisation \n        may be necessary to achieve correct focus, but that's all part of the fun.
