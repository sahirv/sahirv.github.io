            "description": "Yosemite National Park truly is the best that California has to offer. It is home to the iconic El Capitain and Half Dome, towering and ancient sequoia trees, and tens of waterfalls - including Yosemite falls, which drop a whopping 739m. It's almost like finding yourself on a foreign planet. The granite cliffs stand apparent in midst of giant sequioa groves and lush meadows. Finding yourself on top of one of them is a must, as you're treated to incredible vistas unlike any that the rest of the world has to offer.",
