Since this is roughly the size of the average guidescope,\r\n        I thought I could convert this to one. There are many people who have done this and there are plenty of posts about it in forums such as CloudyNights.\r\n        Most people use <a href=\"https://www.firstlightoptics.com/adapters/astro-essentials-sky-watcher-9x50-finder-to-c-adapter.html\">this</a> adapter to connect their camera to the scope. \r\n        I thought I could save money and have it 3D printed instead.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>I'm not much of an expert in CAD so I looked on Thingiverse to see if I could find an STL file of the adapter.\r\n        I found <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3483611/files\">this part</a> and thought it looked promising. Some quick searches revealed that the Datyson\r\n        was similar to the ZWO 120mm Mini camera I own, so I had it printed from a local 3D printing shop for $5. Below on the left is the 3D printed part.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\r\n          <Img fluid={{...data.adapters.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>The part threaded well into the Sky-Watcher finder, but didn't fit properly into the 1.25\" thread on the camera.\r\n        So I had to improvise. The 120mm Mini came with a 1.25\" to C thread adapter. I simply took this adapter and super glued the female C thread side to the \r\n        1.25\" side on the 3D printed adapter.</div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>Unfortunately I hit one more snag. As I tested the camera and new guide scope on random objects in my room, I was unable\r\n        to achieve focus. Turns out the camera was too close to the objective lens of the finder scope. In order to solve this issue, I used a junk \r\n        Celestron 1.25\" T adapter I had lying around. I unscrewed the silver extension bit and T adapter, and was able to thread in the camera from one end.\r\n        In the other end, I slid in the guide scope with the 3D printed adapter + superglued C adapter + 1.25\" extension tube that came with the ZWO camera. \r\n        See the full assembly below.</div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\r\n          <Img fluid={{...data.assembly.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>This solution was put together with things lying around my house, but overall the connection\r\n        from the guide scope to the camera is very sturdy. I plugged my new guide scope into my computer, switched on Sharpcap, and the whole\r\n        thing worked well. Here's a screenshot of Sharpcap as I pointed the scope to a trophy in my room.</div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogImage}>\r\n          <Img fluid={{...data.sharpcap.childImageSharp.fluid}} loading=\"eager\"></Img>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.blogText}>I had to do a lot of googling to find the right 3D printable adapter, as well as to determine whether the 8x50 finder\r\n        would even work at all as a guide scope. I hope this post has helped to inform you that it is possible to convert your 8x50 finder into a guide scope, and\r\n        that it works well! Some improvisation may be necessary to achieve correct focus, but that's all part of the fun.
