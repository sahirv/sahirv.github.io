It came with an 8x50 right angle finder scope (8x magnification with an aperture of 50mm). Since this is roughly the size of the average guidescope, I thought I could convert this to one. There are many people who have done this and there are plenty of posts about it in forums such as CloudyNights.

I simply took this adapter and super glued the female C thread side to the 1.25" side on the 3D printed adapter.'),o.createElement("div",{className:n.c0},'Unfortunately I hit one more snag. As I tested the camera and new guide scope on random objects in my room, I was unable to achieve focus. Turns out the camera was too close to the objective lens of the finder scope. In order to solve this issue, I used a junk Celestron 1.25" T adapter I had lying around. I unscrewed the silver extension bit and T adapter, and was able to thread in the camera from one end. In the other end, I slid in the guide scope with the 3D printed adapter + superglued C adapter + 1.25" extension tube that came with the ZWO camera.

I hope this post has helped to inform you that it is possible to convert your 8x50 finder into a guide scope, and that it works well! Some improvisation may be necessary to achieve correct focus, but that's all part of the fun. Clear skies!")))}}}]);
